                <h1>Vodafone Intranet Redesign</h1>
                <span>Here are some of the things that I've made.</span>

            </header>
                
                <p>During my second year studying Communication and Multimedia Design in Rotterdam, I worked on a hypothetical project for worldwide telecom provider Vodafone. The task was to develop a user-friendly design for a intranet website.</p>
                
                
                <div class="img-holder">
                <img src="img/work/dashboard-vf.png" alt="Snapshot of my design.">
                Snapshot of the dashboard page
                </div>
                
<h3>Debfriefing</h3>
<p>I received a set of very basic wireframes of 4 different pages within the intranet website. For this assignment, I would design a login page, dashboard page, an overview page of all mobile phones currently being sold, and a details page with details about a specific model.</p>

<p>One of the most significant tasks was the task of redesigning all of the modules of information on the different pages, particularly the dashboard and the details page.</p>
                
                <div class="img-holder">
                <img src="img/work/dashboard-vf.png" alt="Snapshot of my design.">
                Snapshot of the dashboard page
                </div>
                
                
                <h2>Brand Analysis</h2>
                <p>I began by getting to know Vodafone in a bit more detail than I had before. I took a look at some of the brand's touchpoints such as it's website, store design and print design. I studied the brand's styleguide and learned about their core values and how they portray those throughout their touchpoints. </p>
                
                <div class="img-holder">
                <img src="img/work/dashboard-vf.png" alt="Snapshot of my design.">
                Snapshot of the dashboard page
                </div>
                
                <h2>Lots of sketching</h2>
                <p>I really enjoy the freedom of quick, rough sketching. I spent a lot of time trying out discovering possibilities and trying out various options either in my Dummy notebook or on scrap pieces of paper.</p>
                
                <!-- INSERT GALLERY HERE with 3-6 sketches -->
                    
                    <p>Warning: My sketches are very rough. I really need to practice sketching quickly, but still keeping things... somewhat pretty.</p>
            

            <div class="img-holder">
                <img src="img/work/dashboard-vf.png" alt="Snapshot of my design.">
                Snapshot of the dashboard page
                </div>

            <h2>Digitization!</h2>
                <p>Next up, it was time to see what I could do to translate all those ideas in my brains, which were now scattered around on all these sheets of paper and in my Dummy notebook, and turn them into digital reality!</p> 
            <!-- fighting emoticon -->
            
            <p>Of course, many of the modules and snippets of the pages took several versions before I felt somewhat satisfied with them. But eventually, I did, at least given the ever approaching deadline. &#40;O_O&#41;</p>
            
            <p>To draw and put together the individual modules, I used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe inDesign.</p>
            
            <div class="img-holder">
                <img src="img/work/dashboard-vf.png" alt="Snapshot of my design.">
                Snapshot of the dashboard page
                </div>
            
            <h2>Watch it all come together</h2>
            <p>Finally, it was time to put it all together and create the final high fidelity mockups of the four webpages. </p>
            
            <p>I used Adobe inDesign for mocking up these 4 pages. I chose to use inDesign for that and not Illustrator because I really find the layout guidelines &#40; margins, columns etc.&#41; very handy for quickly laying things out.</p>
            
            <!-- INSERT GALLERY HERE with 4 pages -->
            
            <h2>Looking back</h2>
            <p>I really enjoyed this project. During this period, I was also really busy with other subjects at school and also things outside of school, so I expected to just barely drag myself through this assignment. But once I buckled down and got to work on it, I found myself genuinely enjoying the work.</p>
            
            <p>This was also my very first time working with so much detailed information and so I was pretty happy with some of the solutions I was able to come up with for the modules &#40;especially on the dashboard and details pages &#41;.</p>
            
            <p>I definitely learned a lot about the significance of good research at the beginning of the design process. It just saves you so much more time in the end when you already have a good amount of information about your client, the target group, stakeholders, or the subject matter.</p>
            
            <p>I also realized that, although sketches aren't meant to be masterpieces of art, they also shouldn't look like an alien language. So, I'm going to pay more attention to that in the future.</p>
