                    <h3>Alright, so I've finally gotten a basic blog page up on my personal site! YEAH!</h3>

                    <p>It's nothing fancy, it's not even properly responsive yet (though I do think mobile-first is the way to go, so I'm getting into that).</p> 
                    <p>Right now, I'm simply going to be writing these posts in Markdown, converting them to HTML and then just manually updating my blog page. All in simple HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>It feels pretty archaic like this, I'm not gonna lie, but something about it makes me feel like I'm forcing myself to get more involved when writing and uploading a post than I would if I would be using, say Wordpress or even Ghost.</p>

                    <p>Of course, this doesn't mean I plan on blogging manually like this forever. But I'll just be enjoying it while it lasts.</p>

                    <p>And right now, I am actually enjoying it.</p>

                    <p>Who would have thought, right?</p>

                    <p><strong>Yesterday I tried out the Ghost flat-file cms</strong>, since, I don't know if you've noticed, but scriptogr.am isn't going to cut it as a personal blog for me. It's a nice, quick way to get blogging, and I love that it syncs op your markdown files via Dropbox. The post editor is also quite lovely.  The problem for me is, there's just not enough freedom when it comes to the appearance of your blog. So, I may be leaving Scriptogr.am  sooner than I had planned. Kinda like asap.</p>

                    <p>So, like I said, I tried out Ghost. You get the first 14 days as a free trial, so I though "Why not?" So far, I <a href="https://kels.ghost.io">have found it to be pretty cool</a>, however, it's still not all that I'm looking for. So, I'm going to continue my search for the perfect blogging solution where I can blog comfortably, and share my posts, beautifully, and seemlessly inside of my portfolio website.</p>

                    <p>One great thing that has come from trying out Ghost is a better understanding of what exactly is most important to me in the choice of such a blogging solution.</p>

                    <p>The two most important things for me at the moment are:
                    - easy customization of blog themes
                    - clear documentation
                    - markdown file importation</p>

                    <p>So I'll be continuing on my way in search of one such solution. I'm hoping that by the end of this week, I can have a much better blogging situation going on here, something that I can stick with for at least the next few weeks.</p>

                    <p>What is this boring theme with boring stuffs and no color?!</p>

                    <p>OK, maybe you're not thinking that at all, but I guess I just thought that might be a cool transition thingy between the title and this post itself. Perhaps I should fine-tune this technique some more...</p>

                    <p>Now, as you can see, this is my new, temporary, personal blog. </p>

                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

                    <p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided that, although I'm currently studying Communication and multimedia design (primarily interaction design), what I really want to do is to be able to be both a designer and a developer. For some reason it seems as if there is a disconnect between school and reality on different levels. And in many ways, I feel that school has been kind of sucking the vibrance and personal initiative out of me.</p>

                    <h4>What do I mean by this?</h4>

                    <p>Well for starters, I've been told several times that being a designer and a developer in one is all but impossible. However, if I just do a quick search online, I can find tons of examples of people who do both.</p>

                    <p>I don't know why the teachers at my school feel this way when there is tons of evidence that this is not true. Sometimes I feel like they're secretly only looking out for their own agenda, which is to keep people reliant on a job, and therefore reliant on an employer.</p>

                    <p>Anyway, I'm rambling.</p>

                    <p>So here's the thing. I believe that experience learning things yourself, designing things yourself, building things yourself is incredibly valuable. Spending the time and effort to research, study and practice things on your own, not because it's this week's homework assignment, but because you want to, is the best way to really excel at what you do. </p>

                    <p>This is the sum of what I've been learning in the past month. Education is not about doing random stuff to gain a piece of paper. It's about developing your character. True education will mold you into an independant adult who is good at what he/she does and does it dilligently and with joy in his/her heart.</p>

                    <h3>So, what is my current goal?</h3>

                    <p>If I'm being completely honest, I'm not 100% sure yet. I know that I want to improve my web development skills so that I'd be good enough to get a job as a front-end developer. But becoming a front-end developer is not an end in itself for me. In the end, I want to work for God. I want to bring glory to Him with my life and with everything I do.</p>

                    <p>So, this journey is not one with any definite destination. I believe that God is leading and training me to serve Him. I will go forward by faith, not knowing exactly where He is leading me, but knowing that He is, in fact, leading.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. -- Hebrews 11:8</p>
                    </blockquote>
