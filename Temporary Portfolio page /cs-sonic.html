                <p>The Design Basics course during my first year studying Communication and Multimedia Design in Rotterdam was a long and exhausting one. It sometimes seemed like the assignments would never get done, because there were so many little, time-consuming things to be done each week. But looking back, I can honestly say I learned a great deal during this course.</p>
                
                <p>This video game cover is just one of the creations that emerged during this course.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h2>The Task at hand</h2>
                
                 

<p>After several weeks of diverse assignments ranging from sketching with charcoal and Siberian chalk, to creating movie posters using Adobe Illustrator, it was finally time for the final assignment of the course. The task would be to find a movie poster, game cover, book cover, or some other type of art/media that we felt could be improved somehow. Then... you guessed it! We get to redesign it! Only, that but two times with two different posters. And only in a few weeks. Quite the challenge lay before me, but it was one I felt excited to take on.</p>

                Analysis of the story of Sonic: Lost World
                </div>
                
                <p>After looking at dozens of different covers, posters and other product art, I decided on my two posters. One of them wasn't a poster at all. It was the cover for a new Sonic game for the Wii U called "Sonic: Lost World". I knew it would be pretty cool to get to work on a game cover, so the excitement increased. </p>

                <h2>Nitpicking stuff is fun</h2>
                
                <p>Before deciding what exactly I wanted to fix about the cover and how, I started by researching the game itself. I grew up playing Sonic game, so I knew a thing or two about Sonic from back then. But I was sure I'd come to find some interesting things about Sonic now and particularly about this specific game, Lost World, that I didn't know.</p>
                
                
                <div class="img-holder">

                Analysis of the story of Sonic: Lost World
                </div>
                

<p>With tons of information about Sonic and all of his adventures fresh in my head, it was time to start looking at the current cover in this new light.</p>

                Notes on what could be improved
                </div>
                
                <p>After analysing the cover, I was able to draw some conclusions about what exactly I though could be improved about this cover. Once I knew what I wanted to fix, I could get straight to it.</p>

                Pretty sketches
                </div>
                
                <p>The sketching process was probably the most time-consuming. I did a lot of experimenting with different ideas for composition and color and things like that. I also wrote a long report &#40;by hand :O&#41; about all my decisions in the process of redesigning the cover.</p>
                
                <div class="img-holder">

                <h2>Lots of sketching</h2>

                </div>
                
                <p>Finally, it was time to work it all out in one definitive cover design. I did this by hand as well as digitally. For the digital version, I used Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>And of course, I also documented all of my final choices in a hand-written report.</p>
