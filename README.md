My very first git repository.
 I hope I can become really good at coding so that I can be a blessing to others.
 Love you love you love you love. <3

Update - March 20, 2015 -
I'm currently working on a personal portfolio website. My plan is to start simple and work my way up to a nicer design and more complex interaction.

Right now, though it's just basic HTML and CSS. I've still got a lot to learn and would love to hear from anyone willing to help. (^-^)/
