My very first git repository.
 I hope I can become really good at coding so that I can be a blessing to others.
 Love you love you love you love. <3

Update - March 20, 2015 -
I'm currently working on a personal portfolio website. My plan is to start simple and work my way up to a nicer design and more complex interaction.

Right now, though it's just basic HTML and CSS. I've still got a lot to learn and would love to hear from anyone willing to help. (^-^)/

This is just a test change to understand the Github Desktop app better. I'm almost getting the impression that understanding the app might end up being just as complicated and understanding how to do everything in the command line. It's still complicated, if not even more complicated.
